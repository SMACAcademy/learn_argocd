Canary releases are a way to roll out features gradually to a subset of users before making them available to everyone. In ArgoCD, this can be implemented by controlling the percentage of traffic sent to different versions of an application.

Here's a simplified example of how to set up a canary release using ArgoCD with Kubernetes and assuming you're using a service mesh like Istio for traffic management, which allows you to define traffic rules easily.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed.
- ArgoCD installed on the cluster.
- Two versions of your application container images available (e.g., `v1.0` and `v1.1`).

### Sample Application Setup

- **Create a Deployment for the Stable Version (v1.0)**:

```yaml
# stable-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-app-stable
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-app
      version: v1.0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-app
        version: v1.0
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sample-app
        image: your-registry/sample-app:v1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

- **Create a Deployment for the Canary Version (v1.1)**:

```yaml
# canary-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-app-canary
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-app
      version: v1.1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-app
        version: v1.1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sample-app
        image: your-registry/sample-app:v1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

- **Create a Service**:

```yaml
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sample-app
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  selector:
    app: sample-app

```

- **Create a VirtualService for Traffic Routing**:

This VirtualService will start by sending 100% of traffic to the stable version and 0% to the canary.

```yaml
# virtual-service.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: sample-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - sample-app
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: sample-app
        subset: v1.0
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: sample-app
        subset: v1.1
      weight: 0

```

- **Create DestinationRules for Subsets**:

```yaml
# destination-rule.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: sample-app
spec:
  host: sample-app
  subsets:
  - name: v1.0
    labels:
      version: v1.0
  - name: v1.1
    labels:
      version: v1.1

```
### Canary Release Process

- **Apply the Stable and Canary Deployments**:

```shell
kubectl apply -f stable-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f canary-deployment.yaml

```

- **Apply the Service and DestinationRules**:

```shell
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f destination-rule.yaml

```

- **Start the Canary Release**:

Initially, 100% of the traffic goes to `v1.0`. You want to shift a small percentage, say 10%, to `v1.1`.

Update the `virtual-service.yaml` to change the weights:

```yaml
# virtual-service.yaml updated weights
spec:
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: sample-app
        subset: v1.0
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: sample-app
        subset: v1.1
      weight: 10

```
Apply the updated VirtualService:

```shell
kubectl apply -f virtual-service.yaml

```

- **Monitor the Canary Version**:

You would monitor the canary by observing metrics, logs, and error rates.


- **Gradually Increase Traffic to the Canary**:

If the canary version performs well, you can gradually shift more traffic to it by updating the weights in the VirtualService.


- **Finalize the Canary Release**:

Once the canary has been proven stable with the desired percentage of traffic, you can shift all traffic to it:

```yaml
# virtual-service.yaml all traffic to v1.1
spec:
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: sample-app
        subset: v1.1
      weight: 100

```
Apply the change:

```shell
kubectl apply -f virtual-service.yaml

```

- **Clean Up**:

Once the canary version becomes the new stable, you can decommission the old stable version:

```shell
kubectl delete deployment sample-app-stable

```
### ArgoCD Synchronization
To manage this process via ArgoCD, make sure all these manifests are committed to your Git repository. Then, create an ArgoCD Application to track this repository and sync it:

```shell
argocd app create sample-app \
  --repo your-git-repository-url \
  --path path-to-manifests \
  --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
  --dest-namespace default

```
You would then use ArgoCD's CLI or UI to sync your application and manage the deployment process.

This example assumes that you have a service mesh like Istio installed in your cluster, which can handle complex traffic routing rules necessary for canary deployments. Without such a service mesh, implementing canary deployments would require a different approach, potentially involving ingress controllers or other traffic management solutions.
